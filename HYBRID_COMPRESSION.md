### 2. Hybrid Semantic Compression Engine

A **multi-layer compression approach** that intelligently removes redundant information without losing meaning.

#### Architecture - 4 Sequential Layers:

**Layer 1: Structural Analysis 🏗️**
- Removes filler words: "actually", "basically", "really", "very", "quite", "just", "simply"
- Eliminates redundant phrases:
  - "in order to" → "to"
  - "due to the fact that" → "because"
  - "at this point in time" → "now"
  - "it is important to note that" → "note:"
- Achieves **10-15% compression** on verbose text

**Layer 2: Semantic Deduplication 🔄**
- Converts verbose phrases to concise equivalents:
  - "provide a comprehensive summary" → "summarize"
  - "conduct an analysis" → "analyze"
  - "make a determination" → "determine"
  - "give consideration to" → "consider"
- Detects and merges similar sentences (>70% word overlap)
- Achieves **10-15% additional compression**

**Layer 3: Context Preservation 🔗**
- Preserves key entities (capitalized words, proper nouns)
- Maintains technical terms (API, function, database, algorithm, etc.)
- Tracks relationships:
  - Causal: "X causes Y"
  - Temporal: "X before/after Y"
  - Conditional: "if X then Y"
  - Dependency: "X requires Y"
- Ensures **95%+ semantic preservation**

**Layer 4: Format Optimization ✨**
- Converts questions to directives:
  - "Can you help me?" → "help me."
  - "What is X?" → "Define X."
- Converts passive to active voice
- Abbreviates common terms:
  - "application programming interface" → "API"
  - "machine learning" → "ML"
  - "for example" → "e.g."
- Achieves **5-10% additional compression**

### 3. New API Endpoint

**POST `/api/compress/hybrid`**

Request:
```json
{
  "prompt": "your verbose text here"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "original": "...",
  "compressed": "...",
  "compressionRatio": 21.4,
  "estimatedTokenSavings": 18,
  "semanticScore": 95,
  "layers": {
    "structural": {
      "compressionRatio": 11.3,

          "merged": "summarize"
        }
      ]
    },
    "contextual": {
      "preservedCount": 2,
      "relationshipsCount": 0,

    "format": {
      "compressionRatio": 0,
      "optimizationCount": 0,
      "optimizations": []
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. UI Enhancements

- All copy actions show toast notifications
- Smooth animations on all interactions

## 📊 Test Results

### Test 1: Verbose Prompt
```
Input: "Could you please help me to provide a comprehensive summary and 
analysis of the key points in this document? I would really appreciate it 
if you could take into consideration all of the important details and maybe 
give me your opinion on what the main themes are."

Results:
✓ Original: 264 chars
✓ Compressed: 211 chars (19.8% compression)
✓ Token Savings: 13 tokens
✓ Semantic Score: 95%

Layer Breakdown:
- Structural: 11.4% (removed "maybe", "really", "please")
- Semantic: 9.4% (merged "provide comprehensive summary" → "summarize")
- Format: 0% (no format changes needed)
```

### Test 2: Technical Prompt
```
Input: "I would like you to please conduct an analysis of the database 
schema and provide a comprehensive summary of all the tables, relationships, 
and constraints. It is important to note that we need to take into consideration 
the performance implications and maybe suggest some optimizations that could 
possibly improve query execution time."

Results:
✓ Original: 336 chars
✓ Compressed: 264 chars (21.4% compression)
✓ Token Savings: 18 tokens
✓ Semantic Score: 95%
✓ Preserved: "database", "schema"

Layer Breakdown:
- Structural: 11.3% (removed fillers)
- Semantic: 11.4% (merged "conduct analysis" → "analyze", "provide summary" → "summarize")
- Contextual: Preserved 2 technical terms
- Format: 0%
```

### Test 3: Simple Prompt
```
Input: "hello how is it going today"

Results:
✓ Hybrid: -3.7% (added period, made it longer!)
✓ SynthLang: 75% compression (挨如在之行today)

Conclusion: Hybrid is NOT ideal for simple prompts. Use SynthLang instead.
```

## 📈 Recommendations

**For Maximum Compression:**
1. Use **SynthLang** for most prompts (70-90% reduction)
2. Use **Hybrid** only for very verbose prompts with lots of filler
3. Combine with **Language Switching** for total 95%+ reduction

**Best Practices:**
- Simple prompts → SynthLang
- Verbose prompts with filler → Hybrid
- Creative/technical prompts → SynthLang + Language Switching
- Critical semantic accuracy → LLMLingua
