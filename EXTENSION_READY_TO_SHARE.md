## 🧪 Test Before Sharing

1. **Reload your extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Find "LLM Optimizer"
   - Click refresh icon (🔄)

2. **Test compression**:
   - Click ⚡ extension icon
   - Enter: "I need you to explain how algorithms work in computer science with very detailed examples"
   - Click "Compress Prompt"
   - **You should see**: Compressed output (even if shorter)

3. **Verify it works**:
   - ✅ Compression ratio shows
   - ✅ Compressed text appears
   - ✅ Copy button works
   - ✅ Export button works

## 🔧 Backend Status

### ✅ Working with Fallback
- **Primary**: Gemini API (when available)
- **Fallback**: Rule-based compression (always works)
- **Result**: Extension always returns compressed text!

### What Was Fixed
1. **Model name** corrected: `gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-1.5-flash`
2. **Error handling** improved with debug logging
3. **Fallback compression** added for reliability
4. **Empty response** handling

### Current Behavior
- If Gemini API works: Full AI-powered compression
- If Gemini API fails: Simple rule-based compression
- Either way: **Extension works!**
