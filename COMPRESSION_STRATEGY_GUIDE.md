# Compression Strategy Selection Guide

## Overview
The AI Suggest Strategy feature uses strict criteria to automatically recommend the optimal compression strategy (LLMLingua, SynthLang, or Hybrid) based on your prompt characteristics.

## Strategy Comparison Table

| Strategy | Compression Rate | Use When... |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **LLMLingua** | 60‚Äì80% | ‚Ä¢ Need one-size-fits-all solution for fast deployment<br>‚Ä¢ Prompts are free-form text without strict formatting (e.g., open-ended Q&A, casual chat, blog posts)<br>‚Ä¢ Maintaining natural readability is more important than absolute compactness<br>‚Ä¢ Domain or task type varies frequently |
| **SynthLang** | 80‚Äì90% | ‚Ä¢ Prompts follow rigid, repeatable structures (e.g., data tables, configuration files, code snippets)<br>‚Ä¢ Can define and learn a small set of custom symbols/glyphs once and reuse them<br>‚Ä¢ Absolute maximum token reduction is critical, can trade off some readability<br>‚Ä¢ Task is narrow and stable (e.g., API request templates, structured planning) |
| **Hybrid Semantic** | 70‚Äì85% | ‚Ä¢ Prompts combine structured elements AND free-form text (e.g., mixed tables + narrative, multi-step instructions)<br>‚Ä¢ Require both strong compression AND semantic fidelity<br>‚Ä¢ Tasks are complex and domain-specific (e.g., technical manuals, multi-stage workflows, policy generation)<br>‚Ä¢ Can invest in multi-layer pipeline for longer-term benefits |

## Quick-Reference Decision Flow

### Question 1: Is your prompt mostly unstructured, natural language?
- **Yes** ‚Üí Use **LLMLingua**
- **No** ‚Üí Go to Question 2

### Question 2: Is the prompt strictly templated or symbolizable (fixed format)?
- **Yes** ‚Üí Use **SynthLang**
- **No** ‚Üí Go to Question 3

### Question 3: Does your prompt mix narrative and structure, or demand highest semantic accuracy?
- **Yes** ‚Üí Use **Hybrid Semantic**
- **No** ‚Üí Revert to **LLMLingua** for simplicity

- **Structured:** Tables, templates, fixed patterns ‚Üí SynthLang
- **Mixed:** Both structured and narrative ‚Üí Hybrid

### 2. **Complexity**
- **Simple:** Single task, straightforward ‚Üí LLMLingua
- **Moderate:** Repeated patterns, templates ‚Üí SynthLang
- **Complex:** Multi-step, domain-specific ‚Üí Hybrid

### 3. **Domain Specificity**
- **General:** Broad topics, varies frequently ‚Üí LLMLingua
- **Narrow:** Specific format, stable task ‚Üí SynthLang
- **Technical:** Domain expertise, multi-faceted ‚Üí Hybrid

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Blog Post (LLMLingua)
**Prompt:**
```
"Write a comprehensive blog post about the future of renewable energy, 
including current challenges, emerging technologies, and predictions for 2030"
```

**Analysis:**
- Structure: Unstructured narrative
- Complexity: Simple single task
- Domain: General topic

**Recommendation:** LLMLingua (70% compression)
**Reasoning:** "Free-form creative writing without strict formatting - LLMLingua preserves readability"

---

### Example 2: API Template (SynthLang)
**Prompt:**
```
"CREATE API endpoint POST /api/users with parameters:
- name: string, required
- email: string, required, validated
- age: integer, optional
Returns: user_id, created_at, status"
```

**Analysis:**
- Structure: Highly structured, templated
- Complexity: Repeated patterns
- Domain: Narrow, stable format

**Recommendation:** SynthLang (85% compression)
**Reasoning:** "Rigid API template with repeatable structure - SynthLang symbols maximize compression"

---

### Example 3: Technical Manual (Hybrid)
**Prompt:**
```
"Create a database migration guide that includes:

Prerequisites table:
| Software | Version | Required |
| PostgreSQL | 14+ | Yes |
| Node.js | 18+ | Yes |

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Backup existing database
2. Run migration scripts
3. Verify data integrity
4. Update connection strings

Include troubleshooting section with common errors and solutions"
```

**Analysis:**
- Structure: Mixed (table + narrative)
- Complexity: Multi-step workflow
- Domain: Technical, domain-specific

**Recommendation:** Hybrid (78% compression)
**Reasoning:** "Combines structured data table with narrative instructions - Hybrid maintains both compression and semantic fidelity"

### Prompt Engineering

The AI uses this decision-making framework:

```typescript
if (mostlyNaturalLanguage && unstructured) {
  return 'llmlingua'; // 60-80% compression
}

if (strictlyTemplated && repeatable) {
  return 'synthlang'; // 80-90% compression
}

if (mixedContent || highSemanticDemand) {
  return 'hybrid'; // 70-85% compression
}

// Default fallback
return 'llmlingua';
```
